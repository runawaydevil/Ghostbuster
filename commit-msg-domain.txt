feat: Configure custom domain ghostbuster.pro for GitHub Pages

## Changes

### Custom Domain Setup
- **Updated all URLs**: Changed from runawaydevil.github.io/Ghostbuster to ghostbuster.pro
  - Updated README.md with new live directory URL
  - Updated sitemap.xml with new domain
  - Updated robots.txt with new sitemap URL
  - CNAME file already configured for custom domain

### Deployment Workflow
- **Added CNAME to deployment**: Ensures custom domain persists after each deploy
- **Updated workflow triggers**: Added CNAME and deploy.yml to trigger paths
  - Changes to CNAME will now trigger automatic deployment
  - Changes to deploy workflow will trigger redeployment

## Impact
- Site will be accessible at https://ghostbuster.pro/
- Site will be accessible at https://ghostbuster.pro/stale.html
- SEO improved with proper sitemap and robots.txt
- Custom domain configuration persists across deployments

## Next Steps
After this commit is pushed:
1. Workflow will automatically deploy to GitHub Pages
2. Configure DNS records for ghostbuster.pro to point to GitHub Pages
3. Enable HTTPS in GitHub Pages settings (automatic with custom domain)
